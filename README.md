# Teaching Cluster Analysis
 
Code for the slides and analysis for cluster-analysis. Note that data is not included and has to be downloaded by hand (and therefore most of the code and the .rmd will not run out of the box).

- Iris-Dataset is included in R
- [Tumor-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) (put that under tumor/)
- [Big-Five-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/big-five-personality-test) (put that under data-final.csv/)
